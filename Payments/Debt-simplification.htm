        <p>Sometimes, DiviDery will prompt you to pay a Group member
that you don’t owe money to. This is an example of DiviDery’s <b>debt
simplification</b> feature. If several Group members owe each other
money, DiviDery uses debt simplification to make payments more efficient.</p>
        <p>For example, if you owe <b>member 1</b> money and <b>member 1</b> also
owes <b>member 2</b> money, DiviDery makes pay <b>member 2</b> directly.
This feature lets you settle both debts with one less transaction.</p>
        <p>With DiviDery’s debt simplification, your Group can settle debts
more efficiently.</p>

Groups. You cannot simplify debts between separate Groups.</p>
